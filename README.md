<h2>You can always count on me when you want to buy me a drink</h2>

<p>I can make you laugh with silly jokes, but I can also do some pep talk</p>

<h2>A funny story</h2>

<p>I can't think of a funny story right now... my life is funny in general, but I am very forgetful. That's probably why I can't come up with a funny story now. That sometimes creates funny situations, and my friends sometimes make fun of this.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>I forgot my funny story, end of story.</p>
